* A base64 encoding implementation by Robert Harder (public domain)

The following people have also contributed to the PIT codebase

Stefan Pendorf - Improved inline consts mutator, member variable mutator and numerous code improvements
Nicolas Rusconi - Ant Task

The above list may be out of date, please check commit history for definitive list of contributors.

Although PIT does not incorporate any code from the Jumble project (http://jumble.sourceforge.net/), the Jumble codebase was used as a guide when developing
some aspects of PIT.
